# abelian-complexity
R script code to extract abelian complexity features, actually we give an python code which is more efficiency
1.Prepared the sequences with fasta format;
2.Make sure that your termination can run python;
3.Run this python script with 'python abel-python.py name1 name2', for which name1 represent the input file name and name2 represent the output file nmae.
# tetra-nucleotide frequency
R script code to extract the tetra-nucleotide frequency
#support vector machine
Support vector machine implementation by lib-svm module and running by R script
1.The main.r controlled the whole SVM process.
2.The process.data.R input the features extracted and process into lib-svm style.
3.The final two R script used to implementation SVM by lib-svm, of which one is for parameters optimization on the basis of accuracy and AUC etc., another is for the main process and finally output all the machine learning parameters for exhibition.
